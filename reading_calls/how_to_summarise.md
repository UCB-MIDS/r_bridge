# Summarising the Information In A Plot 

In this lecture I've just made the argument that you might want to reduce the information that is present in a plot as a method of highlight the core insight that you're trying to communicate. 

Plots are pieces of your rhetorical toolkit when you are communicating about data. As such, you have the ability to highlight (or lowlight) the features of the story that you are telling within your plot. 

This doesn't mean that you can lie with your plots; that's not the goal. But, the goal is to make the clearest argument for what you've learned from the plot, while also communicating how you've learnred that bit. 

In the lecture that you just saw, we accomplish this by smoothing the data using the `stat_smoother()` moving average smoother. 

# Coding task 

- Navigate to the [Datahub](https://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fr_bridge&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master) and open the code `how_to_summarize.Rmd`. 
- This code will ask you to use the `stat_smooth()` function.
