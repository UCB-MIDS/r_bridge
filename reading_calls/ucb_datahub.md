# The UCB Datahub 

The most straightforward way to start working with R is to use the UC Berkeley datahub environment that is provided to you as a student. This hub is located at [http://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu](http://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu) and requires only that you use your UCB Single Sign on to authenticate. Upon following this link: 

- Authenticate with your Single Sign On 
- Click to authorize this app
- Get coding! 

This has built and is running an instance of Rstudio on UC Berkeley resources that you can fully articulate. There are several features to this _out of the box_: 

- Although your datahub is working on a virtual machine, it is not ephemeral. What does this mean, practically? You can return to code that you have written in your datahub, merely by navigating back to the datahub. In fact, even code that you have written but not saved will probably still be accessible then next time that you log-on to the datahub. 
- We have been able to specify libraries that we would like you to use in this instance, and have already compiled them
- We should not undersell how nice this solution is. Thanks to the folks at Berkeley Research IT, BIDS, and CDSS. 
- If you're interested in more detail about the operation of the dathub, you can read about it [here](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/)
