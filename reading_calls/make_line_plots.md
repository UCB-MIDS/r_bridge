# Make Line Plots 

Ok! Now it is your turn agin. I've just talked you through how I might make line plots that represent connections through time. Now, you go and do the same. Like last time, I'll provide you with most of the boilerplate code, and you can do the work to actually write the line plots out.  

- Navigate to the  [UCB Datahub]( https://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fr_bridge&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master)
- Open the file `make_line_plots.R` and create the same plots that I've just created in the lectures.  
- While you should feel welcome to look back at the lecture content, I'll try to provide enough scaffolding that you can write the code without needing to return to the lecture.
