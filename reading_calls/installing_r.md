# Installing R 

R is available to install at https://cran.r-project.org. 

For right now, we want to discourage you from installing locally. Instead, we want you to focus on the work internal to the language; not the dev-ops to be able to use the language. 

## What a local install would mean

Installing locally will mean 

- That you get access to full resources on your local machine :tada: 
- That you have to manage the access to all of those resources :-1: 
- That your setup will be different than everyone else's setup :fire:

For now, when we have a limited view of what we're actually going to need, we think that we shouldn't over-invest in building technology. This probably means that we are "borrowing" from our future and so will have technical debt to pay. But, for right now, being cash rich and using the language is important. 

As an example, many of the high-performance parts of the language use specific C compilers. In the future, if you want to use these tools, you'll have to back-step to install the specific compilers, and then ensure that the rest of what you've built will still work. 

If you choose to go this way, best of luck!
