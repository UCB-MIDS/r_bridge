# Review Code 

This [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016170) applies simple models on top of survey data from respondents who live in rural India. It was published at Nature Energy, which is in the _Nature_ constellation of publication venues. 

I would hate for someone to remark this about my research, but there's nothing really extraordinary about this work. But, we learned something from it. A small thing, but something that _Natue_ thought was important enough to publish. 

Now, the authors publish their data and code along side this work. Follow [this link](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QY5R7R/PVKVR8&version=2.0) which will take you to the core code that authors used to generate these findings. 

# Questions

1. Does this code conform to the coding style guides that you've just read about? 
2. What is one, specific thing that you would do to reformat their code to make it more legible. 

If you're so inclined -- but don't spend more than 5 minutes doing so -- you could paste this code into your Dataverse and restructure some parts of it to make it more legible.
