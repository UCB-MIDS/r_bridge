# Make Scatter Plots 

Ok! Now it is your turn. I've just talked you through how I might make scatter plots that represent features about these squirrels. Now, you go and do the same. 

- Navigate to the  [UCB Datahub]( https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fr_bridge&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master)
- Open the file `make_scatter_plots.R` and create the same plots that I've just created in the lectures.  
- While you should feel welcome to look back at the lecture content, I'll try to provide enough scaffolding that you can write the code without needing to return to the lecture.
