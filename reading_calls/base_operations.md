- Navigate to the [Datahub](https://ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fr_bridge&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master) and open the code `base_operations.Rmd`. 
- This code will ask you to create data of many forms!
- There isn't really a point -- there's no analytic task that I'm asking for, just making data.
