# Reading Call: R Markdown 

Without being **super** clear about it, for the last several units we've been using R Markdown documents. These are documents that let you mix code and description into a single plain text file. 

There are several benefits to this: 

- You can document your code in place
- You can produce reports from your code that are **always** in sync with the data and codebase
- You can share these documents with others; and keep them under version control 

Now, I'd like you to read a little more detail about the system in R For Data Science. Please read the following: 

- [Chapter 26](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html) in the digital version of _R For Data Science_ and [Chapter 27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) in the same. 
- In Chapter 27, read sections 1-6, skipping section 7. 
- If you're reading in the physical copy, these are the chapters about "Communicating" and "R Markdown"
